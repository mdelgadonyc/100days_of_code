Coffee Machine Program Requirements

4. Check resources sufficient?
a. When the user chooses a drink, the program should check if there are enough
resources to make that drink.
b. E.g. if Latte requires 200ml water but there is only 100ml left in the machine. It should
not continue to make the drink but print: ‚ÄúSorry there is not enough water.‚Äù
c. The same should happen if another resource is depleted, e.g. milk or coffee.
5. Process coins.
a. If there are sufficient resources to make the drink selected, then the program should
prompt the user to insert coins.
b. Remember that quarters = $0.25, dimes = $0.10, nickles = $0.05, pennies = $0.01
c. Calculate the monetary value of the coins inserted. E.g. 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 1 nickel, 2
pennies = 0.25 + 0.1 x 2 + 0.05 + 0.01 x 2 = $0.52
6. Check transaction successful?
a. Check that the user has inserted enough money to purchase the drink they selected.
E.g Latte cost $2.50, but they only inserted $0.52 then after counting the coins the
program should say ‚ÄúSorry that's not enough money. Money refunded.‚Äù.
b. But if the user has inserted enough money, then the cost of the drink gets added to the
machine as the profit and this will be reflected the next time ‚Äúreport‚Äù is triggered. E.g.
Water: 100ml
Milk: 50ml
Coffee: 76g
Money: $2.5
c. If the user has inserted too much money, the machine should offer change.
E.g. ‚ÄúHere is $2.45 dollars in change.‚Äù The change should be rounded to 2 decimal
places.
7. Make Coffee.
a. If the transaction is successful and there are enough resources to make the drink the
user selected, then the ingredients to make the drink should be deducted from the
coffee machine resources.
E.g. report before purchasing latte:
Water: 300ml
Milk: 200ml
Coffee: 100g
Money: $0
Report after purchasing latte:
Water: 100ml
Milk: 50ml
Coffee: 76g
Money: $2.5
b. Once all resources have been deducted, tell the user ‚ÄúHere is your latte. Enjoy!‚Äù. If
latte was their choice of drink.
