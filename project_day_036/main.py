## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#dailyadj [NOTE: #daily is now premium only]
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

# TODO 1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries.
#  e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]

parameters = {

yesterday_stock_data = data['Time Series (Daily)'][yesterday_date]
yesterday_stock_price = float(yesterday_stock_data['4. close'])
print(yesterday_stock_price)

# TODO 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp
price_difference = abs(today_stock_price - yesterday_stock_price)
print(f"price different is: ${price_difference:.2f}")

# TODO 4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.
percentage = price_difference / yesterday_stock_price
print(f"Stock price percentage difference is {(percentage * 100):.2f}%")

# TODO 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").
if percentage > 5:
    print("Get News")
    ## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/ 
    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME. 

# TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.
# All articles about Tesla from the last month, sorted by recent first
# GET
# https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=tesla&from=2023-06-06&sortBy=publishedAt&apiKey=API_KEY

# TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation


## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.

# TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

# TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.


# Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
"""
